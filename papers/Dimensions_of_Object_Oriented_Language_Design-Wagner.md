Synopsis

The dimension considered in this paper are:

 1. Objects
 2. Classes
 3. Inheritence
 4. Strong typing
 5. Concurrency
 6. Persistence


Objects, Classes and Inheritence
--------------------------------

Objects are autonomous entities with state.
Unlike functions, which for each input
return the same output, objects can behave
differently as they evolve over time.

A language is **object oriented** if it supports
objects. Objects are a neccesity but not sufficient
on their own to call a language objected oriented.

An object-based language is **object oriented** if objects
belong to classes and class hierarchies can be defined
via inheritence.

That is, **Object Oriented = Objects + Classes + Inheritence**

### Class

A class is a template (like a cookie cutter) for creating new objects.

### Inheritence

A mechanism for sharing resources among classes.
