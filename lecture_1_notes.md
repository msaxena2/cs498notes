## Classical Logical Argument

- Every Man is Mortal
- Socrates in a Man 

Hence, Socrates is Mortal. The meaning of the premises is not important. The validity of the argument is only dependent of the structure of the argument, and not the meaning of the premises of the arguments themselves.

Forall x, M(x) -> D(x), M(S) |- D(S). This is a valid argument due to the presence of a theorem in propositional logic verifying the argument.
