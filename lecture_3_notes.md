#### Relevance lemma

If two models M and M', map the propositions occuring in a formula \phi, then M \enatils \phi iff M' \enails \phi.


### Decision Problem 

Givem a  model, find whether a foumola satisifes can be done in P time (O(n)) where is is  \phi|


### Cook's theory

If a sat problem can be reduced to another problem, then the other problem must also be NP complete.


### Validity

\phi is valid iff ~\phi is not satisfiable.
