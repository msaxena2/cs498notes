## Proposition Logic

* A propositional formula can be thought of a curcuit, with wires as propositions, and gates making formulae.
* A countable set is the smallest infinite set. S is a countably inifinite set if its element can be enumerated as a0, a1, a2, . Set of reals is not countable. N is countable. I is countable, with ordering for instance like 0, -1, 1, -2, ..... Rationals are countable. 
* A set of finite strings over an alphabet is countable. Real numbers cannot be represented as a set of finite strings over numbers, hence it's not countable.



 Fix \P, a countable set of propsitions {p0, p1, ..}. Syntax of prop. logic 


 Let WFF be the smalles set such that, p in P is in WFF if \phi and \phi' are in WFF, then (\phi /\ \phi'), (\phi \/ \phi') and (\not phi) are also in WFF.
